# WKNC-Roku
Roku application to play the WKNC live radio streams

### Dev Environment
I am using VS Code with the Brightscript plugin https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript, though any dev environment should do.

### How to deploy for development
Roku instructions here: https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md  
The VS Code plugin makes it very easy to 1-click deploy to a local Roku box, that is what I would recommend.

### Other Dependancies
The program pulls the list of stations from a XML file, currently I am hosting that on a gist.

### Attributions
Losely based off of the AudioListSample from the Roku sample library at https://github.com/rokudev/samples
